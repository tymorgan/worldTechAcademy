						Why Do I Need to Learn How To Code?

						<h4><b>Why is learning to code important?</b></h4>
						<p>
							Learning to code is about more than building software or websites. It is literally about beginning to understand the world around you. Almost everything we do during our day involves some sort of code. Whether that is answering the phone, checking email, watching T.V., even driving your car! The future will belong to those individuals who understand how the world works. A super detailed and specialized understanding of coding is not completely necessary, however, the more specialized skills you posses the greater impact you can make in the world around you. Knowing how to code will at a bare minimum allow you to engage intellectually with those who do understand it in depth. It will allow you to understand constraints and possibilities that face current developers. It could be that small differentiator  that sets you apart from the rest of your peers.
							<br /><br>
							The world of technology is like a thriving city with giant walls around the outside. Only qualified individuals are able to pass through the gates to unlimited opportunity and prosperity. The qualification is knowing how to code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Don’t get left out side the gates of the city of technology. <a href="index.html">Learn to code today!</a>
						</p>

								“Our policy at Facebook is literally to hire as many talented engineers as we can find. There just aren't enough people who are trained and have these skills today.”
							</p>
							<p class="quote-author">

						</blockquote>
						<p>
							You may say that coding does not apply to my career, profession or industry. Although that may be true right now, I am sure you have already noticed automated systems coming into your workplace, software, applications, programs that make your job easier for you to do. The more complex and more integrated these systems get the more valuable will be the technical understanding of how these systems work. Save your self the struggle of mis-understanding computer systems and software. Start learning how it works, increase your knowledge, you will never regret it.  Even some <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/chris-bosh-why-everyone-should-learn-to-code/">NBA basketball players</a> are learning how to code because of it's relevance to EVERY career, why wouldn’t you?

							If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on and the dedication to go through with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Well you’re in your little room and you’re working on something good but if it’s really good you’re gonna need a bigger room and when you’re in the bigger room you might not know what to do you might have to think of how you got started sitting in your little room.

						</p>
						<p>
							Chances are, unless I’m a designer, I don’t know what I want. All I know is I want something functional that looks good, is comparable with my competitors, and features constant colour schemes for branding.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ll look at other designs that have already been created and ask for something similar. Hence, it is important that you can take the information I give and help me visualize what it is you 
							<a href="#">think I want.</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							I want everything we do to be beautiful. I don’t give a damn whether the client understands that that’s worth anything, or that the client thinks it’s worth anything, or whether it is worth anything. It’s worth it to me. It’s the way I want to live my life. I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares.
						</p>
						<p>
							Inspiration is hogwash. My work comes directly out of my loves and hates. Muses don’t whisper in my ear, and ideas don’t flow over my body like a cool rain.
							<br />
							Functionality is so over-valued in design, and we’ve kept design very small in that way. Functionality is the sheer minimum. If your house burns down, what do you take? The cat in the window that you got from your mother, or the chair you have?
