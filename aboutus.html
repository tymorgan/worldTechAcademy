					<p>
						World Tech Academy started with an idea that learning to code should be affordale and acheivable for everyone. We started a small class and hired a professional programmer and the rest is history. Ever since our first class we have striven to provide our students with not only the best educational experience but also with all of the tools needed to be successful as a developer.  
					</p>
					<p>
						We are passionate about the idea that individual development is enhanced through the aquisition of valuable and applicable skills and here at World Tech Academy we teach modern skills that are relevant in any profession today.
					</p>
					<p> 
						What sets World Tech Academy apart is exposure to professional mentors, emphasis on education techniques, and paired programming & networking. We make sure our class sizes are small and we employ many experienced mentors to make sure each student can get their questions answered
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>
						 immediately. On our management team we have hired professional educators to train out instructors on how to be proficient teachers. Our instructors mploy the best group learning dynamics and teach to the level of the students. Much of the work professional developers do will be done in team settings. We emphasize learning as a class and assign students to work on teams to complete projects. This helps students learn how to best work in a team environment and also increases the strength of the network within the class, which we have seen open up future opportunities for many of our students.

					<h2>FAQs</h2>
					
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row feature backwards">
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>Do I have to pay all of the tuition up front?</h4>
					<p>
						We require a down payment up front the amount of which is decided based on each individual student's financial needs. We prefer an up front payment of the remaining balance but we offer flexible payment options on a case-by-case basis. At the time of enrollment we can make a plan that works for each student. Our goal is to make these classes affordable for everyone so we can discuss a plan that works for you! 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>What kind of computer do I need?</h4>
					<p>
						While we do not recommend any specific model of computer we do recommend having a personal computer that is no more than 5 years old, has a decent running speed, and is able to have a stable connection to a wireless internet network. The rest of the tools you will need on your computer we will help you get together on the first day of class!
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>Say I for some reason have to stop taking the class, what is your refund policy?</h4>
					<p>
						We are sure you will love the class, but we understand that things happen sometimes! If for some reason you are unable to continue the class you are entitled to a refund. Until the end of the first week if you drop the class you can receive a full refund of tuition paid not including the down payment. If you are not able to continue the class after the first week grace period, you can receive a prorated refund based on the number of classes that have occured, excluding your down payment. We want to make sure we are fair to our students that have things come up and also cover our costs. Talk to s about any concerns and we can make sure to work with you!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>What kind of certification do I get upon graduating from your program?</h4>
					<p>
						Upon graduating you will earn a Certificate of Completion. The certificate is to help show future employers that you have completed a coding course. Your most important proof of ability coming out of the class will be your portfolio website that will show off all of the projects you have worked on in and out of the class. In the development world experience speaks loudly and we make sure you have lots of practice and can show off what you have built to any future employer. We will help you build and fill your portfolio with many diverse projects using all the languages of the course! 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>How do you help students with job placement or with finding freelance work?</h4>
					<p>
						We have connections around Utah with companies looking to hire our students. We constantly network and look for opportunities for our students. We begin to notify you of opportunities as soon as you start class and setup  connections between you and potential employers while you are in class. This is the same for freelance work and often students an make money building websites while still in the class.  
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>Are there any prerequisites to the classes?</h4>
					<p>
						We take people from all skill levels and have no prerequisites to joining our class. We only ask that you are motivated, hard-working, a team player and that you finish the pre-class assignments. We will explain those assignments once your application is accepted.  
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				
				
				<div class="col-md-6 info">
					<h4>Do I use my own computer or do you provide one?</h4>
					<p>
						You provide your own computer that you bring to class each period. This is to keep the cost of the class down and so that you can use the same computer to work on all of the assignments at home. If you need help acquiring a computer contact us and we can help you.
